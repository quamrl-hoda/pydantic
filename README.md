# Pydantic Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains examples and exercises demonstrating how to use **Pydantic**, a powerful data validation and settings management library for Python. Pydantic helps define Python classes with automatic type checking, data parsing, and validation â€” making code cleaner, safer, and more reliable.

##  Features
-  Easy data validation with type hints  
-  Automatic type conversion  
-  Clear error messages  
-  Environment variable management  
-  Integrates with FastAPI and other frameworks

##  Example
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
